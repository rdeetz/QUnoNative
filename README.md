## Developer Notes

This repository includes experimental implementations of QUno in C++. They are inspired 
by the original QUno implementations in MFC and ATL, but brought into the world of 
modern Windows and C++.

* `QUnoComponent` contains the game engine. This is a Windows Runtime Component modeled after 
`QUnoLibrary` in the [QUnoEngine](https://github.com/rdeetz/QUnoEngine) repository. 
* `QUnoBare` contains a Universal Windows Platform application implemented with C++/WinRT that uses 
`Windows.ApplicationModel.Core.CoreApplication` directly and draws a user interface 
using the Composition layer.
* `QUnoDirect` contains a Universal Windows Platform application using DirectX 12.
* `QUnoReunion` contains a Windows desktop application implemented using C++/WinRT and the 
[Windows UI Library](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml).
